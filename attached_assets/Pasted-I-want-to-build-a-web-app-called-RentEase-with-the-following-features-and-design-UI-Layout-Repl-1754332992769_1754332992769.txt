I want to build a web app called RentEase with the following features and design:

✨ UI Layout (Replit-style Onboarding)
Use a split-screen layout:

Left Side: Form fields with step-based onboarding (personal info, password, property details)

Right Side: A large background image or illustration, with motivational heading and short description text — like Replit's onboarding/login UI.

Example:

|        Form Section         |     Image with message       |
|                             |                              |
|   [Logo]                    |  [Illustration of a house]   |
|   Welcome! Let’s begin.     |  "Manage your rentals smart."|
|   [Name]                    |                              |
|   [Email]                   |                              |
|   [Next]                    |                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
🔒 Authentication Flow
Landing page with two CTAs:

Start as Landlord

Start as Tenant

Clicking either takes user to a multi-step onboarding form with Replit-style layout.

🧩 Multi-Step Onboarding
🔹 Step 1: Personal Info
Full Name

Email

Next button

🔹 Step 2: Create Password
Password (with eye icon toggle)

Confirm Password

Back / Next buttons

🔹 Step 3: Property Details
If Landlord:

Property Name

Property Type (dropdown): Studio, Bedsitter, 1 Bedroom, 2 Bedroom, 3 Bedroom, Custom

Utility Bills: dynamic inputs or checkboxes for electricity, water, garbage, security, internet, and others

Option to add multiple properties (with "+ Add Property" button)

If Tenant:

Search or select apartment name (already registered by landlord)

Select unit type or house number

🗃️ Database
MongoDB Atlas (I'll provide the URI)

Database: RentEase

Collections: landlords, tenants, properties

📍After Onboarding
Each user is redirected to a dashboard view depending on their role.

Sidebar Navigation:

Please scaffold this using Replit's clean, responsive onboarding layout. Use simple starter code (React or HTML/CSS/JS) and let the transitions between steps feel smooth.
